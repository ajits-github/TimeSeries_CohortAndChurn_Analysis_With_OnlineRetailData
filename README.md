# TimeSeries_with_MultiVariate_OnlineRetail_Data
We will look into the application of machine learning tasks like classification and clustering with online retail data

We will use a public data set of retail transactions published in the UCI [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail).
This is a transnational data set that contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
